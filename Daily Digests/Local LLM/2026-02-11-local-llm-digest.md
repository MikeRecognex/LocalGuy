## 1. Unsloth Achieves 12x Faster MoE Training with 35% Less VRAM

Unsloth's new custom Triton kernels enable training Mixture of Experts models 12x faster while using 35% less VRAM (under 15GB) and supporting 6x longer context windows. This breakthrough makes MoE fine-tuning accessible to practitioners with consumer hardware, potentially democratizing advanced model customization.

## 3. 80B LLM Runs at 18 tok/s on NAS iGPU Without Discrete GPU

A practitioner successfully deployed an 80B parameter model on a NAS system using only integrated GPU, achieving 18 tokens per second inference speed. This demonstrates the viability of running large models on specialized hardware configurations without expensive discrete GPUs, opening new possibilities for home lab deployments.
