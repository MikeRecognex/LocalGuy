The go-micro team has published a comprehensive guide on integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) with microservices architecture to create AI-native distributed systems. This approach enables better integration patterns for local LLM deployments at scale.

The post explores how MCP can bridge the gap between traditional microservices and AI workloads, providing standardized communication protocols for LLM inference services. This is particularly relevant for organizations looking to deploy multiple local models across distributed infrastructure while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.

For local LLM practitioners, this represents a significant step toward production-ready deployment patterns that can scale beyond single-node setups. The integration patterns discussed could help teams build more robust local AI systems with proper service isolation and communication protocols.
