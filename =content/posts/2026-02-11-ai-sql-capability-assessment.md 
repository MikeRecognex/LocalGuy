A comprehensive evaluation titled "Are AI SQL Yet?" examines the current capabilities of various AI models in generating accurate SQL queries, providing valuable benchmarks for practitioners considering local deployment of database-querying AI systems.

The assessment covers multiple dimensions of SQL generation capability, from basic queries to complex joins and analytical functions. For local deployment scenarios, this evaluation helps determine which models are suitable for database-related tasks and what level of accuracy can be expected in production environments.

Local LLM practitioners working with business intelligence, data analysis, or database administration tools will find these benchmarks particularly useful for model selection. The results can guide decisions about which models to deploy locally for SQL generation tasks and help set appropriate expectations for end users.
