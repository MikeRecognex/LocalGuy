This is the first post on the new site. It's built with Obsidian and Eleventy — Markdown in, static HTML out.

## Why This Exists

I wanted a publishing workflow that puts the writer first. No CMS login, no database, no platform lock-in. Just a folder of Markdown files that become a website.

## What's Next

- Add Giscus comments backed by GitHub Discussions
- Set up RSS feeds
- Write about things that matter

More soon.
