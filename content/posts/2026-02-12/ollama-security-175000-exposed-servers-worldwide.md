Security researchers have discovered approximately 175,000 publicly accessible Ollama servers across 130 countries, revealing a widespread security issue in local LLM deployments. These exposed instances potentially allow unauthorized access to private AI models and the underlying infrastructure.

The findings highlight critical security oversights in how practitioners deploy Ollama servers, particularly regarding network exposure and access controls. Many of these installations appear to be running without proper authentication or firewall protections, creating significant privacy and security risks.

This discovery serves as an urgent reminder for the local LLM community to implement proper security hardening when deploying Ollama and similar tools. The research emphasizes the importance of network segmentation, authentication, and monitoring in production deployments.
