AMD has announced free access to its Developer Cloud for running OpenClaw with vLLM inference workloads. This initiative provides developers with complimentary GPU resources to experiment with and deploy large language models without the upfront hardware costs.

The program is particularly valuable for practitioners developing local LLM solutions who need access to high-performance GPUs for testing and optimization. OpenClaw, combined with vLLM's efficient inference engine, offers a powerful stack for model deployment and experimentation.

This move democratizes access to enterprise-grade AI infrastructure, allowing developers to prototype and benchmark local LLM deployments before investing in their own hardware.
