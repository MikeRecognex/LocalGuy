Security researchers have uncovered a massive exposure of Ollama AI servers, with over 175,000 instances found running without proper access controls across 130 countries. These misconfigured deployments allow unauthorized access to local LLM inference capabilities and potentially sensitive model data.

The discovery highlights a critical gap in deployment security practices among users setting up local AI infrastructure. Many administrators appear to be exposing Ollama's default port (11434) directly to the internet without implementing proper authentication or network segmentation.

For local LLM practitioners, this serves as an urgent reminder to audit their Ollama deployments and implement proper security measures. Essential steps include configuring firewall rules, using reverse proxies with authentication, and restricting network access to trusted sources only.
