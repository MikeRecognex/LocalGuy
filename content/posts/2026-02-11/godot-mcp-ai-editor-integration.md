A new open-source project called Godot MCP has emerged that allows AI assistants to gain full access to the Godot game engine editor through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This integration represents a significant step forward in AI-assisted development workflows, enabling local AI models to directly manipulate game development environments and automate complex tasks.

For local LLM practitioners, this demonstrates the growing ecosystem of MCP integrations that make locally-run AI assistants more capable and useful in real-world applications. The ability to give AI models direct access to development tools through standardized protocols like MCP is particularly valuable for those running models locally, as it enables sophisticated automation without relying on cloud-based services.

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomyud1/godot-mcp) and showcases how local AI deployments can be enhanced through thoughtful integration with existing development tools and workflows.
