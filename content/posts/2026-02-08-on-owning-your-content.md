Every post you write on someone else's platform is a gift to their shareholders. The words are yours but the distribution, the audience, the archive — that belongs to them.

## The Alternative

Publish on your own domain. Syndicate everywhere. Let the conversations come back to you.

It's not about isolation. It's about having a home base that you control.

## What You Get

- **Permanence**: Your URLs don't break when a company pivots
- **Portability**: Markdown files work everywhere
- **Independence**: No algorithm decides who sees your writing

The web was designed for this. We just forgot.
