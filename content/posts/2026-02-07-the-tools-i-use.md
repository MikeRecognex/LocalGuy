This site runs on a simple stack:

- **Obsidian** for writing — it's just Markdown files in a folder
- **Eleventy** for building — transforms Markdown into static HTML
- **Git** for versioning — every edit is tracked
- **Static hosting** for delivery — fast, free, global

No database. No CMS. No JavaScript frameworks. The entire site is HTML and CSS.

## Why Eleventy?

It does one thing well: take a folder of templates and content files and produce a folder of HTML. It's fast, flexible, and stays out of the way.

The build takes less than a second. The output is just files. There's nothing to maintain.
