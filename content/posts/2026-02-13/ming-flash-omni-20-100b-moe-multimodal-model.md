Ant Group has open-sourced [Ming-flash-omni-2.0](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ming-flash-omni-2.0), a groundbreaking 100B parameter MoE model that activates only 6B parameters during inference. This truly omni-modal architecture handles image, text, video, and audio inputs while generating image, text, and audio outputs in a single unified model.

What sets this model apart is its comprehensive audio generation capabilities, including speech synthesis, sound effects, and music generation alongside traditional vision-language tasks. The MoE architecture makes it feasible to run locally despite the 100B total parameter count.

For local deployment enthusiasts, this represents a major step toward unified multimodal AI systems that can handle diverse content types without needing separate specialized models. The efficient MoE design means practitioners can access advanced multimodal capabilities while keeping memory requirements manageable at just 6B active parameters.
