An undergraduate student has achieved a remarkable milestone by training Dhi-5B, a 5 billion parameter multimodal language model from scratch using just ₹1.1 lakh ($1,200) in compute costs. The [project announcement](https://i.redd.it/5tsgquvue7jg1.png) highlights the use of compute-optimal training techniques and latest architectural innovations with a custom-built training codebase.

This demonstration proves that advanced multimodal AI development is increasingly accessible to individual researchers and small teams with limited budgets. The student incorporated cutting-edge architecture design and training methodologies, showing that innovation doesn't require massive corporate resources.

For the local LLM community, this represents both inspiration and practical evidence that high-quality models can be developed cost-effectively. The $1,200 training budget makes such projects feasible for hobbyists, researchers, and small organizations, potentially democratizing AI development and encouraging more diverse approaches to model training and specialization.
